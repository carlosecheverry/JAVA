### Java-12 - Unit Testing with JUnit


#### Part 1: Writing Unit Tests

1.Open the Drive package and explore the classes and what they do.

2. Open the *DriversManagerTest* class and implement unit test for the following scenarios:
* Verify a Passenger is added correctly
* Verify a Driver is added correctly

3. Implement the following unit test in the *DriversManagerTest* class:

     ```java
        @Test
        public void startTripTest(){
    
        }
    
        @Test
        public void endTripTest(){
    
        }
     ```
#### Part 2: Test Driven Development
1. Implement the following unit test so it fails:
     ```java
        @Test
        public void nextAvailableDriverTest(){
    
        }
     ```

#### Challenge Yourself
1. As you can see this algorithm is not very fair since it does not consider distance and drivers
will always get paid the same fee. Modify the code so it considers distance too.
